# Eleanor Auto

Eleanor Auto is a one-page responsive website that showcases a clean layout coupled with bold yet elegant animations to tell the story from picking your car to driving a new car every month. It was designed on Figma by Reform Collective, and I developed it using React, styled-components, and GSAP.
